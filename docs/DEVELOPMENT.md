# Development

THe purpose of this document is to describe how to run a development loop on the tech stack, using the `local-path` flavored bundle.

## Contributing

The [CONTRIBUTING.md](../.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) is the source of truth for actions to be performed prior to committing to a branch in the repository. Read that first before following the rest of this guide.

## Bundle Building

To build a bundle, use the tasks located in the `CREATE AND DEPLOY BUNDLES` section of the [tasks.yaml](../tasks.yaml). Be careful to note the difference between pulling the LATEST remote packages and bundle, and creating + deploying the local DEV versions of the packages and bundle.
